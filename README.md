## What I used in this project ❓

* This website is made with <strong>Bootstrap5</strong>.

* I used Bootstrap <strong>Navbar</strong> component to create a simple collapsable navbar.

* I used <strong>Carousel</strong> component to make a beautifull slider.

* I used row and col classes again and again to create responsive rows and columns.

* I used <strong>Card</strong> component to create some images with texts.

* I used <strong>Nav</strong> component with pills and also added <strong>tab</strong> Javascript plugin.

* I created <strong>form</strong> element using Bootstrap.

* I used <strong>fslightbox</strong> plugin to create pop-ups for some images.

* I can say that I used almost every Bootstrap component in this project. 😅
